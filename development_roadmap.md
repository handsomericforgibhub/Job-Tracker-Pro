-- NEW: Project hierarchy tables
projects (id, name, client_name, site_address, planned_start_date, total_budget, company_id)
project_stages (id, project_id, stage_name, sequence_order, color, status, completion_percentage)
project_stage_templates (id, template_name, industry_type, stages, is_system_template)
project_stage_history (id, stage_id, old_status, new_status, changed_by, changed_at)

-- UPDATED: Jobs table with project relationships
jobs (id, title, project_id, project_stage_id, is_standalone, ...) -- Added project fields

-- PLANNED: Calendar and billing tables
calendar_events (id, project_id, category, start_time, weather_sensitive, requires_client_meeting)
billing_ranks (id, company_id, rank_number, discount_percentage, locked_until)
```

### **Environment Configuration**
