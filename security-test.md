# Security Fixes Validation Guide

## Overview
This guide helps validate the security fixes implemented for the JobTracker platform's RBAC system.

## Fixed Security Issues

### ‚úÖ Critical Issues Fixed

1. **SQL Execution Endpoint Secured** (`/api/admin/run-sql/route.ts`)
   - Added site_admin role validation
   - Implemented rate limiting (5 requests/hour)
   - Added dangerous query pattern blocking
   - Added audit logging

2. **Site Admin API Routes Secured**
   - `/api/site-admin/companies/route.ts` - Now requires site_admin authentication
   - `/api/site-admin/jobs/route.ts` - Now requires site_admin authentication

3. **Admin Stages Route Secured** (`/api/admin/stages/route.ts`)
   - Replaced SERVICE_ROLE_KEY with proper authentication
   - Added role-based access control (site_admin, owner)
   - Company context validation

4. **Analytics Route Secured** (`/api/analytics/route.ts`)
   - Fixed cross-company data access vulnerability
   - Proper company_id validation
   - Role-based data filtering

5. **Core API Routes Secured**
   - `/api/jobs/route.ts` - Added authentication and company validation
   - `/api/jobs/[id]/route.ts` - Added authentication and company validation
   - `/api/workers/route.ts` - Added authentication and company validation

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Middleware Implemented

- **Centralized Authentication** (`/src/lib/auth-middleware.ts`)
  - JWT token validation
  - User profile verification
  - Role-based authorization
  - Company access validation
  - Rate limiting
  - Error handling with proper status codes

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Authentication Testing

```bash
# Test unauthenticated access (should fail)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/site-admin/companies"

# Test with invalid token (should fail)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/site-admin/companies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token"

# Test with valid token (should succeed for site_admin only)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/site-admin/companies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Testing

```bash
# Site admin access to cross-company data (should succeed)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/analytics?company_id=different_company_id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SITE_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Owner attempting cross-company access (should fail)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/analytics?company_id=different_company_id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer OWNER_TOKEN"
```

### 3. SQL Execution Security Testing

```bash
# Dangerous SQL should be blocked
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/run-sql" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SITE_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "DROP TABLE users;"}'

# Rate limiting test (6th request within an hour should fail)
for i in {1..6}; do
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/run-sql" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer SITE_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"sql": "SELECT 1;"}'
done
```

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Secure Responses

1. **Unauthenticated requests return 401**:
```json
{
  "error": "No authorization header provided",
  "code": "NO_AUTH_HEADER",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-XX..."
}
```

2. **Insufficient permissions return 403**:
```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient permissions. Required roles: site_admin. User role: owner",
  "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS"
}
```

3. **Cross-company access blocked for non-site_admin**:
```json
{
  "error": "Access denied. User can only access their own company data",
  "code": "COMPANY_ACCESS_DENIED"
}
```

4. **Rate limiting triggered**:
```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Too many requests.",
  "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"
}
```

### ‚úÖ Successful Authenticated Responses

All successful responses now include metadata:
```json
{
  "data": "...",
  "metadata": {
    "accessed_by": "user@example.com",
    "accessed_at": "2025-01-XX...",
    "company_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

## Remaining Security Considerations

### Medium Priority (Future Work)

1. **Additional API Routes**: Some less critical routes still need authentication
2. **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation for all request parameters
3. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for all admin actions
4. **Session Management**: Token refresh and expiration handling

### Monitoring & Alerting

Consider implementing:
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Unusual cross-company access attempt alerts
- Rate limiting violation alerts
- SQL execution monitoring for site admins

## Frontend Impact

The security fixes should be transparent to the frontend as long as:
1. Proper Authorization headers are included in all API calls
2. Error handling accounts for new 401/403 response codes
3. Site admin context switching continues to work properly

## Database Security

The RLS (Row Level Security) policies remain the final line of defense:
- All database queries are filtered by user's company_id (except site_admin)
- Even if middleware is bypassed, RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access
- Site admin role properly bypasses RLS restrictions where intended

## Conclusion

These fixes address the critical security vulnerabilities identified in the audit:
- ‚ùå **33% of routes had no authentication** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **All critical routes now secured**
- ‚ùå **Cross-company data exposure** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Proper company isolation enforced** 
- ‚ùå **SERVICE_ROLE_KEY abuse** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Proper authentication patterns implemented**
- ‚ùå **SQL injection vector** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Secured with validation and rate limiting**

The platform now has enterprise-grade security controls in place.
